== README
This is the Source code to the demo app presented at the Lagos on Rails October 2015 event.

For proper implementation, you'll need to:
- Setup a google gcm account for your app:  https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/
- Set value for `gcm_sender_id` in assets/javascript/nottification_manifest.json.erb
- Set endpoints for the `fetch` requests in notification_manager.js
